Game Of Life
------------------------------------------------
Animates and plays Conway's game of life

Usage
------------------------------------------------
Usage:  python game_of_life_runner.py [options].

If "--filename" is NOT passed in, the user can type in the board they want to
test. Hit return twice to mark that the input board is complete. Boards should
look like:

0 0
0 1

where "0"s represent dead cells and "1"s represent live cells.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --animator ANIMATOR   How to animate the game of life. Acceptable ANIMATORS
                        include: "curses", and "print_all". "curses" uses
                        `curses`, a terminal control library for Unix-like
                        systems to draw and refresh the screen. Hitting "q"
                        will quit out of the process. "print_all" prints each
                        iteration, one at a time, blank line separated.
                        "print_all" creates an animator that runs indefinitely
                        so this process will need to be explicitly killed via
                        ctrl-c. The default ANIMATOR is "curses". This can not
                        be used together with "--step-to-print
  --filename FILENAME   If passed in takes a input file that describes the
                        initial grid. Grids look like "0", "1" with spaces
                        representing different columns and new lines
                        representing different rows. Please look at
                        "boards/blinker.txt" to see an example of a valid
                        board.
  --step-to-print STEP_TO_PRINT
                        The step to print. The initial step is step 1. This
                        can not be used together with "--animator".
